            Number of classes (NC) 	& Metric that measures package size which determine no. of concrete and abstract classes \cite{s68_understandability}. \\
            \midrule Afferent Couplings(Ca) & Metric that measures incoming dependencies for package which determine no. of other packages that depend on classes within package \cite{s68_understandability}. \\
            \midrule Efferent Coupling (Ce)	& Metric that measures outgoing dependencies for package which determine no. of other packages that classes in package depend upon \cite{s68_understandability, s116_maintainability}. \\

            Instability (I) 	& It is ratio of efferent coupling to total coupling. Total coupling is Afferent and efferent coupling \cite{s68_understandability}. \\

            Distance (D)	& It measures perpendicular distance of package from idealized line which indicates package balance between abstractness and stability \cite{s68_understandability}. \\
